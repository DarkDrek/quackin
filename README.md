Release the quackin! ðŸ¦†

Quackin is a recommender systems framework written in Rust. This is a young
project, which means two things:

- There will be a lot of breaking changes until version 1.0
- Is a perfect project for your contributions ;)

Quackin was concieved as a framework for collaborative filtering recommender
systems. But it is open to new ideas. If you want to contribute in some way
open or start working on an issue or ping me at z1mvader@protonmail.com.

One of the difficulties for developing this crate is that the Rust's machine
learning and data mining [ecosystem](http://www.arewelearningyet.com/) is on
an early stage, then there is no standard libraries for anything yet.
Nevertheless, I believe that we should take advantage of the control and speed
that Rust offers to provide a competitive alternative to frameworks written
in languages with a more developed ecosystem like Python or Java.
